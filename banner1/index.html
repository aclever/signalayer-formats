    <h3>How we convert leads with Signalayer & Smooch</h3>

    <p>Great content is a lead magnet. However, connecting with your leads when they engage with your content is a
        challenge. This is how we use our own product (and a few others) to engineer for timely interactions.</p>

    <p>Content marketing is a powerful channel for acquiring leads. A whitepaper, case study or a recorded demo will
        help
        to nurture future customers. Naturally, we want to know the people who engage with our content, so we can follow
        up
        with them. That’s why good content is often hidden behind a contact form, i.e. tell us who you are before we
        give
        you this content.</p>

    <h3>No “paywall”</h3>

    <p>We want our customers to engage with our content. We also want to engage with them. But we don’t want the
        “paywall” to stand in the way. Instead we’ll ask for their information later, when it’s timely and relevant.</p>


    <h3>2. Display content online</h3>

    <p>When it comes to printed word, you’d often download an actual file to your computer. This brings an extra few
        steps of locating the file and then opening it with a native application. More importantly, we lose touch with
        the customer.</p>

    <p>Instead, we want to present our content online, where it’s a click away. But also, so we can track interaction
        with our content in order to engage user when it’s most relevant.</p>
